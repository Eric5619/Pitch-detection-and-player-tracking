Software for the detection of a badminton
court and then players on the court are implemented. 

The solutions for the following tasks are implemented:

Task 1: Image frames detection - for this part of the assignment, you are asked to utilise
both colour segmentation and pattern segmentation to extract all the frames in the
provided video clips that contain the full badminton court.

Task 2: Court detection - for all the extracted image frames that contain the full view of
the court, you are asked to annotate the court with lines.

Task 3: Player detection - for this part, you are asked to exploit one of the taught
algorithms to extract bounding boxes that identify the players on the court. If a person is
detected outside the court, its bounding box must be discarded as an outlier.

Task 4: Player tracking - for this part, you are asked to use one of the taught techniques to
track the players.

They are two zip files containing image frames of short clips of two badminton matches, a
single and a double, both played at international level. For simplicity, image frames from clips
have been extracted and compressed in zip files.
